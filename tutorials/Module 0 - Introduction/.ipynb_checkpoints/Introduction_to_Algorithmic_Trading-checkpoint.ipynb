    "> A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, they are akin to regular currencies but digital. Instead of having banks or the government keep track of your wallet balance, this is done by computers that connect to a cryptocurrency network to process transactions and earn cryptocurrency (In the case of Bitcoin, it is called \"mining\") for doing so.\n",

    "\n",
    "According to [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en), there are currently more than 8000 cryptocurrencies out there. Broadly speaking they can be divided into two types, **coins** and **tokens**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cryptocurrency coins** belong to cryptocurrency networks that were built from the ground up.\n",
    "\n",
    "As cryptocurrency networks are so hard to make from scratch, only a few dozen cryptocurrencies are actually coins (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc). The rest are **cryptocurrency tokens**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing to remember about cryptocurrency tokens is that a lot of them are nothing more than scams. This is primarily because cryptocurrency tokens are so easy to create.\n",

    "### 💰Explaining Cryptocurrency Price And Value💰\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes cryptocurrencies valuable? For the case of Bitcoin (BTC), some says it has an economic profile to gold. It has a maximum supply and only a small amount of BTC is created each day, and that amount is cut in half every 4 years.\n"

    "# 2. Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "Trading involves more frequent transactions, such as the buying and selling of stocks, commodities, currency pairs, or other instruments. The goal is to generate returns that outperform buy-and-hold investing. While investors may be content with annual returns of 10% to 15%, traders might seek a 10% return each month. Trading profits are generated by buying at a lower price and selling at a higher price within a relatively short period of time. The reverse also is true: trading profits can be made by selling at a higher price and buying to cover at a lower price (known as \"selling short\") to profit in falling markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trading vs Investing\n",
    "\n",
    "from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/difference-investing-trading.asp),\n",
    "> Investing and trading are two very different methods of attempting to profit in the financial markets. Both investors and traders seek profits through market participation. In general, investors seek larger returns over an extended period through buying and holding. Traders, by contrast, take advantage of both rising and falling markets to enter and exit positions over a shorter time frame, taking smaller, more frequent profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traders generally fall into these categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Fundamental Trader**: \n",
    "    - Fundamentalists trade companies based on fundamental analysis, which examines corporate events, particularly actual or anticipated earnings reports, stock splits, reorganizations, or acquisitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Momentum Trading**: \n",
    "    - Momentum traders seek stocks that are moving significantly in one direction in high volume. These traders attempt to ride the momentum to the desired profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Technical Trading**: \n",
    "    - Technical traders focus on charts and graphs. They analyze lines on stock or index graphs for signs of convergence or divergence that might indicate buy or sell signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Swing Trader**: \n",
    "    - They are fundamental traders who hold their positions longer than a single day. Most fundamentalists are really swing trading since changes in corporate fundamentals typically require several days or even weeks to produce a price movement sufficient for the trader to claim a reasonable profit.\n",
    "    - Positions are held from days to weeks.\n",
    "- **Day Trader**: \n",
    "    - Positions are held throughout the day only with no overnight positions.\n",
    "- **Scalp Trader**: \n",
    "    - A scalper is an individual who makes dozens or hundreds of trades per day in an attempt to \"scalp\" a small profit from each trade by exploiting the bid-ask spread. \n",
    "    - Positions are held for seconds to minutes with no overnight positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway is that trading involves short-term strategies to maximize returns daily, monthly, or quarterly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Analysis vs Fundamental Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Analysis is based on human psychology, namely emotions like fear and greed. It posits that these emotions are ultimately what drive prices up or down, and that these emotions create visible patterns which repeat themselves. This means that with the right methodology, the future price action of an asset can be predicted using technical analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Technical analysis was invented almost 300 years ago by a Japanese rice merchant name Hunma Munehisa, who is believed to be the most successful trader of all time. He wrote the first book on market psychology, and the principles he defined continue to be used in technical trading today. \n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Analysis focuses exclusively on price and does not pay much attention to fundamentals. For cryptocurrencies, fundamental factors include things like tokenomics, network activity, the strength of the project’s development team, and any notable partnerships the project has. These fundamentals are often used by HODLers and more experienced traders to gauge the long-term price potential of an asset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the average cryptocurrency trader is irrational, many believe that technical analysis is more effective than fundamental analysis for this reason. As a rule of thumb, technical analysis should be used for shorter term trading whereas fundamental analysis should be used for long term trading. A combination of both is necessary to ensure a clear picture of the cryptocurrency you are trading. \n",
    "\n",

    "[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/f911dDCELX4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f911dDCELX4 \"Original\")\n",
    "## Trading cryptocurrencies\n",
    "Although the cryptocurrency market is relatively new, it has experienced significant volatility due to huge amounts of short-term speculative interest. Such volality makes the crypto market attractive for traders so, as speculative interest. \n",
