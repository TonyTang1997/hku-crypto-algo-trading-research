# Moving Average Trend Following 

Moving Average is a family of most well-known technical indicators adopted by different traders. 

The formal statistical definition of moving average is the calculation of averages of different subsets (rolling window) of all the observations.

The main motivation of using a moving average is to reduce noise from our observations so that we can spot the trend from a security's price data more easily. 

There many different kinds of moving averages and we are going to cover three of them,

1. Simple Moving Average

2. Volume Weighted Moving Average

3. Exponential Weighted Moving Average

## Simple Moving Average

Simple Moving Average (SMA) is the most basic form of a moving average which is taking the arithmetric mean of a rolling window of data.

Definiton of arithmetic mean : the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.

Simple Moving Average is easy to be implemented and understanded by traders while effective to smooth a raw price time series. However, it gives the same weightings to trade observations with different volume or occured at different time.

Volume Weighted Moving Average and Exponential Weighted Moving Average are enchancement of SMA.
