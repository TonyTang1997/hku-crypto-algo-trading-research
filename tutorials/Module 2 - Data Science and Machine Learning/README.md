# <ins> Module 2 - Data Science and Machine Learning <ins/>

This module serves to give you an introduction to programming for data science, and to lead you into the world of Machine Learning. We'll talk about Pandas first and after this, you'd be ready for Machine Learning. Using Machine Learning in algo-trading is intuitive and many times can outperform other traditional methods.
