Many times, you'll need to review lessons several times. Programming also necessitates hands-on expertise; instead of reading/watching the examples, actively follow along on your computer. Learning programming is similar to learning how to drive a car or doing physical fitness exercises. it is not possible to attain the skills solely by reading about it and/or viewing videos.\n","\n","You are recommended to read this article: [How to teach yourself hard things](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/01/learning-skills-you-can-practice/)\n","\n","Solving practice problems is very useful to review your understanding. After familiarizing with basics, try experimenting with your newly acquired skills. If you get stuck, you can search online/documentation/books for those specific problems (go to the Optional Resources below for more), and if that fails, you can ask us for help.\n","\n","## The Tutorial\n","\n","\n","You will be learning the basics of python from the tutorials on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), a pupular platform for data science competitions and also a source of useful datasets. Catered towards data science (which is relevant to algotrading), Kaggle will be main learning resource for this module as the tutorials are interactive and filled with examples. You will also get to try out some exercises inside Kaggle notebooks after learning each subtopic.\n","\n","https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python\n","\n","## Overview\n","1.  [Syntax](#s1)\n","2.
