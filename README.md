# Cryptocurrency Algorithmic Trading

## Developed by HKU-SCF FinTech Academy

This github repo serves you as a directory for the whole learning process about cryptocurrency and algorithmic trading. 
Topics related to algorithmic trading will be discussed, such as motivations of adopting it (especially in the crypto market), 
an overview of knowledge required to start algotrading, and the general procedure of building algorithmic trading stretegies. 

This README provides a general picture of the upcomming tutorials aimmed at equipping you with the necessary knowledge 
and skills to build and deploy your own algotrading strategy.
